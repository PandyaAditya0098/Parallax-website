                Cycling (also known as bicycling or biking) is the riding of bicycles (also cycles, or bikes) for leisure or as part of competition. In many countries, the cycle is also an important mode of transport, more so in Asia (especially in Southeast Asia) and Africa. In Europe, cycling is predominantly a recreational activity. The continent is very much the hub of cycling as a competitive sport, but modern Europeans are increasingly inclined to use the bike as a favoured mode of transport (from home to office  and back). Indeed, across the world today, the cycle is the preferred means of conveyance for many commuters.

                The beauty and diversity of India  both natural and architectural  can best be experienced on a saddle. A cycle tour in the mountains and forests, or through national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, can make for a charming (and unforgettable) introduction to India. And on a bike, one can savour the freedom to explore and discover the country at leisure, and at the same time meet her people and learn about her culture. India offers some classic cycling trips, as well as some delightful out-of-the-way trails. Rajasthan presents an exotic cycling holiday unlike any other, while down south, the Bangalore-Goa trail, through the red-earth state of Karnataka, has a magic all its own.

                The dream of flying in the sky just like a bird is as old as human kind. You can make your dream come true with paragliding. This sport is considered to be risky, but the reality is that the safety of practitioners is quite high, especially compared to other adventure disciplines. Of course, you cannot paraglide unless you have undergone extensive training. There are numerous paragliding schools that you can select from. It is only natural for you to look for courses in your local area, but there are a number of other essential factors that you have to consider carefully as well.

                <br><br>

                The first thing to decide on is the type of paragliding that you want to practice. The glider is made from one canopy. The entire mechanism represents the one of a parachute. The gliding principle is the same. However, given that the paraglider is lighter and more portable, it is easier to fly. You can readily start training for this discipline in any of the paragliding schools. Once you master the necessary skills, you can you can start on your own.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="para">
                Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. 

                <br><br>

                Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing.
